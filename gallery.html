            <p>Initially this watercolor was brought to me for replacement of broken glass.  
            The corners of the old frame had opened up a bit which indicates that it had been 
            dropped and the artwork itself had disloged from its' mounting.  
            The edges of the artwork were showing signs of decay from resting in the paper mats for years.</p>
            <p>After repairing the frame, I remounted the piece with linen hinges, gave it fresh 
                Conservation double mats, and installed Conservation glass which blocks 99% of UV light.</p>
            <p>Being impressed with the quality of the work, I researched the artist, 
                Karen Rosasco,and found that she had taught high school art for thirty years and 
                resided in Delansen, NY. Upon retirement, she moved to Shenandoah Valley, Virginia, 
                where her career took off. She is a Signature Member of American Watercolor Society 
                and her work has been admired and displayed internationally. 
                Although she is best known for her work as a Watermedia Artist, 
                she has also worked with acrylic. The title of this artwork is "Canal Laundry".</p>

            <p>I recently framed this print of Wassily Kandinskys's "Improvisation 13 {sea battle}" 
                Generally credited as pioneer of abstract art, this Russian artist sometimes used 
                musical terms to identify his works.  He called his most spontanious paintings 
                "improvisations" and more elaborate works as "compsitions".</p>

            <p>I recently framed this Mellisa Etheridge album that is a "Barnes and Noble exclusive release".  
                It was signed at Barnes and Nobble in NYC on its' release date, April 12, 2019.</p>
            <p>The greatest challenge in this project was to find a mat that would not clash with 
                the Opaque Violet vinyl.</p>

        <div class="description">
            <p>Rolling Stones Sticky Fingers, released on April 23, 1971. 
                The original cover artwork was conceived by none other than ANDY WARHOL. 
                If you are ever in Pittsburgh, the Andy Warhol Museum is a "must see".</p>

            <p>This 36" x 24" print that I framed, now hangs in a home on Lake George in the town of Hague.</p>
            <p>The artist, John F. Kensett, was a second generation artist of the Hudson River School. 
                Kensett is best known for his landscape painting of Upstate New York and New England. 
                This particular scene is from around the Diamond Point area of Lake George in 1869. 
                The original oil on canvas is displayed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>

            <p>This metal artwork was cut and stamped by a Haitian artisan. 
                It was a gift to a client who wanted it mounted and framed. 
                It is now displayed over their fireplace</p>
