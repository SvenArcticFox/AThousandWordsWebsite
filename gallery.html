        <div><p>Initially this watercolor was brought to me for replacement of broken glass.  
            The corners of the old frame had opened up a bit which indicates that it had been 
            dropped and the artwork itself had disloged from its' mounting.  
            The edges of the artwork were showing signs of decay from resting in the paper mats for years.</p>
            <p>After repairing the frame, I remounted the piece with linen hinges, gave it fresh 
                Conservation double mats, and installed Conservation glass which blocks 99% of UV light.</p>
            <p>Being impressed with the quality of the work, I researched the artist, 
                Karen Rosasco,and found that she had taught high school art for thirty years and 
                resided in Delansen, NY. Upon retirement, she moved to Shenandoah Valley, Virginia, 
                where her career took off. She is a Signature Member of American Watercolor Society 
                and her work has been admired and displayed internationally. 
                Although she is best known for her work as a Watermedia Artist, 
                she has also worked with acrylic. The title of this artwork is "Canal Laundry".</p>
