    <h2>My name is Jody Radez</h2>
    <p>Why picture framing? I have been working with my hands and creative designing for over 50 years. 
        Whether as a musician, woodworker, or renovation designer, 
        I've gained much satisfaction from presenting a finished product that is appreciated. 
        The available time that retirement offers is an opportunity to participate in the visual arts.
    </p>
    <p>
        I studied this craft with Frank Miragliotta who is a well 
        known and respected picture framer of over 40 years in Long Island.
